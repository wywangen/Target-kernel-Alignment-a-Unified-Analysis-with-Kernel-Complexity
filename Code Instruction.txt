The Python code for On the Target-kernel Alignment: a Unified Analysis with Kernel Complexity

alpha.ipynb is demonstrating the impact of alpha, in other words, choice of kernel on kernel alignment. 
Other 4 ipynb file, including demo_krr.ipynb, demo_logistic.ipynb, demo_quantile.ipynb, demo_svm.ipynb 
aim to show under some condition truncated and different loss function the kernel method is better than
 traditional kernel method. function.py contain all needed function used in previous 5 demo ipynb files.
