# Target-kernel-Alignment-a-Unified-Analysis-with-Kernel-Complexity


The file `alpha.ipynb` demonstrates the impact of the parameter \(\alpha\), specifically the choice of kernel, 
on kernel alignment. The other four notebooks—`demo_krr.ipynb`, `demo_logistic.ipynb`, `demo_quantile.ipynb`, 
and `demo_svm.ipynb`—aim to illustrate that under certain conditions, including truncation and the use of 
different loss functions, the modified kernel method performs better than traditional kernel methods. 
The file `function.py` contains all the necessary functions used across the five demo notebooks.
